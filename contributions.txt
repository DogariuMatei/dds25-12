Zeryab: Full working version using Sentinels and Watchdogs for availability and consistency.
        Didn't keep it because of scaling issues, but availability was amazing. This was probably the most difficult implementation (find work in  branch: zeri_sentinel_v2)

Tadas: Working Kafka version (didn't keep this one bc kafka is too complex), transitioned to reservation-less stock service (we kept this one),
       in depth consistency testing (rly good job). (find work in branch: kafka_setup ; main)

Nick: Working 2PC version (we didn't stick with this implementation, too slow) and helped with k8s deployment of final version (find work in branch: nick_branch; main).

Matei: Main Micorservices design (with stock reservation) and k8s deployment. Also, provided good vibes (find work in branch: main).
